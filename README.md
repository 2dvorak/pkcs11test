PKCS11TEST
==========

This repository holds a test suite for the
[PKCS #11](http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/standards-initiatives/pkcs-11-cryptographic-token-interface-standard.htm)
API.  To build the test program on Linux, just run `make`.

Test Options
------------

The test program requires the following command-line parameters to be set:

 - `-m libname`: Provide the name of the PKCS#11 library to test.
 - `-l libpath`: Provide the path holding the PKCS#11 library.

There are also several optional command-line parameters:

 - `-s slotid`: Provide the slot ID that will be used for the tests
 - `-v`: Generate verbose output.
 - `-u pwd`: Provide the user PIN/password.
 - `-o pwd`: Provide the security officer PIN/password.
 - `-I`: Perform token initialization tests. **This will wipe the contents of the PKCS#11 token**

The test program uses [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/), and
the
[Google Test command line options](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/V1_6_AdvancedGuide#Running_Test_Programs:_Advanced_Options)
are also available.  In particular, `--gtest_filter=filter` can be used to run a subset of the tests.
